# pic-lib

A collection of [mostly self-written] C libraries for PIC microntrollers.

Most of the libraries are self-documenting, some with descriptions about their usage.

## Contribution
Contributions are always welcome.

Please try as much as possible to make any libraries you want to contribute to be easily portable and as self-documenting as possible.
Also, endeavour to follow the existing project structure.

If you happen to make some improvements to these libraries or port them to another chip, please consider contributing.

Thanks.
